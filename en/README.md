## Summary

![](/assets/xtend2.png)

CUAV XTEND Radio is a high-power, high-speed, high-reception sensitivity data transmission module

It has built-in XTEND RF module of USA DIGI Company, launches the power up to 1000mw, ISM 900MHZ legal frequency, supports many advanced network options and topological modes

The CUAV XTEND Radio module offers an unprecedented range of low-cost wireless data solutions. This module is easy to use, especially suitable for unmanned unit networks and point-to-point over-the-horizon transmission, providing stable, critical data transmission between drones and equipment. Their small size saves valuable on-board space.
